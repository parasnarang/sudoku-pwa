# 🚀 Deployment Guide

This guide covers all deployment options for the Sudoku PWA, including GitHub Pages.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- Node.js 18+ installed
- All dependencies installed: `npm install`
- Tests passing: `npm run validate`

## 🌐 GitHub Pages Deployment

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Fork or clone the repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will automatically deploy on pushes to `main` branch

3. **Access your deployed app** at:
   ```
   https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/sudoku-pwa
   ```

### Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually:

```bash
# Install gh-pages if not already installed
npm install gh-pages --save-dev

# Build and deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy:github-pages
```

### GitHub Pages Configuration

The following files are configured for GitHub Pages:

- **`.github/workflows/github-pages.yml`**: Automated deployment workflow
- **`.nojekyll`**: Prevents Jekyll processing (important for SPAs)
- **Build system**: Handles GitHub Pages base URL configuration

### Important Notes for GitHub Pages

1. **Base URL Handling**: The build system automatically configures asset paths for GitHub Pages subdirectory deployment

2. **Service Worker**: Will work correctly with the configured base URL

3. **PWA Features**: All PWA features (offline support, install prompt) work on GitHub Pages

4. **HTTPS**: GitHub Pages automatically provides HTTPS, which is required for PWA features

## 🔧 Other Deployment Options

### Netlify
```bash
npm run deploy:netlify
```
- Drag & drop the `dist/` folder to Netlify
- Or connect your GitHub repo for automatic deployments

### Vercel
```bash
npm run deploy:vercel
```
- Import your GitHub repository
- Vercel will auto-detect and deploy

### Firebase Hosting
```bash
npm run deploy:firebase
```
- Requires Firebase CLI and project setup
- Excellent for PWA features

### Docker
```bash
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:run
```
- Self-hosted option
- Includes nginx configuration

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### GitHub Pages Specific
- **CDN**: GitHub Pages uses a global CDN
- **Caching**: Static assets are cached automatically
- **Compression**: gzip compression is enabled
- **HTTP/2**: Supported by default

### Optimization Tips
- The build system automatically:
  - Minifies all assets
  - Generates cache-busting hashes
  - Optimizes images and icons
  - Creates efficient service worker

## 🔒 Security on GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages automatically provides:
- HTTPS encryption
- DDoS protection
- Security headers (configured in our build)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common GitHub Pages Issues

1. **404 on refresh**: 
   - ✅ Handled by our SPA configuration in the build system

2. **Assets not loading**:
   - ✅ Build system handles base URL path configuration

3. **Service Worker not registering**:
   - ✅ Service worker paths are correctly configured for subdirectory deployment

4. **PWA install prompt not showing**:
   - Ensure you're accessing via HTTPS
   - Check browser compatibility

### Build Issues

If deployment fails:

```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build

# Check for errors
npm run lint
npm run test:headless
```

## 📈 Monitoring

After deployment, you can monitor:

- **Performance**: Use Lighthouse to test your deployed site
- **Analytics**: The PWA includes built-in performance monitoring
- **Errors**: Check browser dev tools for any deployment-specific issues

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Test locally first**: Always run `npm run build && npm start` to test production build
2. **Validate deployment**: Check all PWA features work after deployment  
3. **Monitor performance**: Use the built-in performance monitoring
4. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regular security updates

## 📞 Support

If you encounter deployment issues:
- Check the GitHub Actions logs for build errors
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Test the production build locally first
